## Kabocha pallet ingredients 

We will start of with governance and "NFT" functionality. Thereafter will be customising governance to be more like Liquid Democracy, we will also be adding functionality to the treasury funding process, where new coins can be minted based on successful proposals, instead of just taking from treasury.  
## In the works:
This parachain will have novel governance function. We will be working on Liquid Democracy, which will remove the need for council and instead be more focussed on meta-delegation.
